# FinancialTracker Capstone

This is my first capstone for the Fall 2023 Course of the Pluralsight Learn-To-Code Academy.

## Details
This project contains a multifaceted CLI, centered around parsing and interfacing with a .csv file containing a list of transactions. The user has the ability to add both payments and deposits to the file, and display its contents as well. This was made to show what I have learned over the past 4 weeks, and showcase my capabilities and style as a programmer.

Error checking and best practices exists throughout, thanks to the use of frequent commenting, try-catch blocks, and other control structures such as if-else and switch statements.

## Why is it Impressive?
In order to complete this project, I also had to do a sizeable amount of research on my own, to help get the specifics of the more fanciful aspects of the program in order, such as the formatted text created via ANSI Escape Codes, the custom search function via Lambda Expressions, and the multi-field Comparator used to handle sorting the arraylist that is output to the user.
